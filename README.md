# OneLastMerch2

School project that contains redo of OneLastMerch (the main repo on my account)

The project is based on [OneLastMerch](https://github.com/JaQubus/OneLastMerch).

## IMPORTANT NOTES

OneLastMerch (later refered to as OLM) -> project that has shop-like features, featuring *OneLast*. OneLast was a SCI++ (school) project.

## Technologies

OLM2 will use [Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/) there is a chance it will use 100% django just as OLM did.
