# OneLastMerch2

School project that contains redo of OneLastMerch (the main repo on my account)

The project is based on [OneLastMerch](https://github.com/JaQubus/OneLastMerch).

## IMPORTANT NOTES

OneLastMerch (later refered to as OLM) -> project that has shop-like features, featuring *OneLast*. OneLast was a SCI++ (school) project.

This time i will focus on creating the project in more intended ways. Last time I wanted this to be a complex and very intense project, meanwhile this time i will try to use the intended solutions rather than forcing my own ideas.

The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
*Simple is better than complex.*
*Complex is better than complicated.*
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

## Technologies

OLM2 will use [Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/) there is a chance it will use 100% django just as OLM did.

## How to turn on

In the directory of manage.py use:

- python -m manage runserver

The insert of items should happen automatically on app start
